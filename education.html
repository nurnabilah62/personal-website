       <span style="font-family:Kristen ITC"><p><font size="4"> 
     <center> <p>I was studied in SMK Guar Perahu for 5 years which is from Form 1 until Form 5. I took religion classes from Form 1 until Form 3. This class is very special because it is the only class that has taken an additional subject which is 'Kelas Kemahiran Quran' and also 'Bahasa Arab'. I gained more knowledge when I took  these subjects which is it taught me about 'tajwid' and 'tarannum'.   During  form 4, I took pure science stream subject which have 11 subjects and I need to elective subject which is engineering drawing.  For me, it is quite interesting learning science because I can explore more on humans, plants, and animals.  I need to focus for those subject since I will sitting for SPM examination where it determines the direction of my life in future. </p> </center>

     <center> <p>Before I continued my studies, I feel quite sad but at the same time I feel quite excited when I check the UPU's result because the offer letter stating that I have succeeded in continuing my studies in UITM Dungun. I feel sad because it is my first time to be apart from my family. I feel like I am not ready to further my studies. Then, I am having a discussion with my parents and family. At last, my family and I are agreed to receive the offer letter. I think this is the best decision that I have made. So, I register at UITM Dungun on May 21, 2017. I became the UITM's student and took the course Diploma in Office Management and Technology(BA118). I am very grateful to be given the opportunity to continue my studies here. Uitm Dungun has an attractive scenery and also have a beach in front of UITM's gate. If you feel stress, feel free to be at the beach and released tension. I also feel grateful to be surrounding by good people and good friends.</p> </center>
